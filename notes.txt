So We have the header area plus 12347 lines of hexadecimal or 16 bytes per line. 
2 bytes or one hexadecimal group is a single sample.
This means we have a 16-bit per sample precision but that may not be needed
Maximum amplitude: 0.157349
Minimum amplitude: -0.110443
Midline amplitude: 0.023453
Mean norm: 0.034500
Mean amplitude: 0.029567
RMS amplitude: 0.041125
Maximum delta: 0.064484
Minimum delta: 0.000000
Mean delta: 0.009759

We can see the mean delta indicates
